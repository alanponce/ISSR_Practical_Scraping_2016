# ISSR Practical Web and Text Scraping 2016

## Overview

This Git repo contains all materials necessary for this ISSR Practical Web and Text Scraping workshop. You can email me at <mdenny@psu.edu> or <matthewjdenny@gmail.com> with any questions. There are lots of materials available on my website at: <http://www.mjdenny.com/teaching.html>. To download the materials you see here, you will want to start by downloading a GUI client for Git. 

* For Windows: <https://windows.github.com/>
* For Mac: <https://mac.github.com/>
* For Linux, you may have to rely on the command line, although <https://git-scm.com/downloads/guis> has some options (depending on your distro).

You will then want to `clone` this repo onto your computer using either the 

    https://github.com/matthewjdenny/ISSR_Data_Science_Summer_Summit_15.git

link and your client or by clicking the "Clone in Desktop" button on the right hand side of the page. If you want to directly edit the files posted here and track your changes, you can copy individual files into another directory and create your own repo with the files in it.  We will go over using Github in detail on the first morning of the workshop, so there is no need to spend too much time trying to figure Github out.
